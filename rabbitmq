right now, each socket process is connecting to the amqp...
when instead, each SERVER should have one connection...
when the connection receives a message (the message should contain, the process names for the socket registry)
=> it should send the message to all the socket processes.
=> the sockets will then handle it.......oh. that makes so much more sense..
